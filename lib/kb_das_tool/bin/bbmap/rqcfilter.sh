Description:  Performs quality-trimming, artifact removal, linker-trimming, adapter trimming, and spike-in removal using BBDukF.
Performs human/cat/dog/mouse/microbe removal using BBMap.
NOTE!  This program uses hard-coded paths and will only run on Genepool.
It requires 39500m RAM for mousecatdoghuman, but only 1GB or so without them.

Java Parameters:
-Xmx                This will be passed to Java to set memory usage, overriding the program's automatic memory detection.

-eoom               This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da                 Disable assertions.

*****   All additional parameters supported by BBDuk may also be used, and will be passed directly to BBDuk   *****
